This is my part of the full "FlowStock" project:

ðŸ”§ My Contribution
I worked on the ["Backend/database"], mainly focusing on:

Database design â€“ structured how inventory data is stored and accessed

Backend logic â€“ handled data processing and interaction with files or databases

Features I implemented:

Inventory tracking

Adding and managing customers

Adding/editing/removing stock items

Filtering stock by category

handling transactions

creating  time based reports(day,month,year)

CSV/Excel file handling















ðŸ’¡ Notes
I used Java for all backend logic.

Data is stored locally in CSV files (i made this before even studying Mysql).
