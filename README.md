# 🔧 My Contribution – StockFlow Backend

This is my part of the full **StockFlow** project.  
I focused on the **Backend and Database Layer**, building the core logic that powers the system.

## ✅ Responsibilities & Features I Implemented

- **Inventory Tracking**  
  Handled storage, updates, and quantity checks of stock items.

- **Customer Management**  
  Implemented logic for adding and managing customer records.

- **Stock Item Operations**  
  Built functions to add, edit, and remove stock items efficiently.

- **Category Filtering**  
  Enabled viewing stock items based on their category.

- **Transaction Handling**  
  Developed backend logic to record and process transactions.

- **Time-Based Reporting**  
  Created daily, monthly, and yearly reports using backend date filtering.

- **CSV/Excel File Handling**  
  All data is stored and managed through local CSV files, simulating a database structure.

## 🗃️ Technologies Used

- **Java** for all backend logic and file operations.
- **CSV Files** as the primary data storage (used before learning MySQL).

## 📌 Notes

- This version of StockFlow does not use a traditional database like MySQL.
- All features are implemented using file-based storage to simulate backend behavior.
- The system is designed to be modular and upgradeable to database support in the future.
















💡 Notes
I used Java for all backend logic.

Data is stored locally in CSV files (i made this before even studying Mysql).
